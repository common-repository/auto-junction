Allows you to display commission junction affiliate products realted to individual blog posts.

== Description ==

Auto Junction allows you to display commission junction products related to your blog posts. When you write a blog post you can use a special custom field to add a keyword. The auto-junction plugin then goes out and gets related products from companies you are affiliated with through commission junction. This allows you to sell products off your blog posts but also display RELATED products if not the actual thing.
